# Recommender-System
We built a crowdsourced recommender system from scratch using 8,000+ beer reviews scraped from BeerAdvocate.com. Our system allows users to specify three preferred attributes (e.g., “fruity,” “hoppy,” “crisp”) and returns the top three beer recommendations using multiple recommendation techniques
